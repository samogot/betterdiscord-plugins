## Installation

Likely you are using stable BetterDiscord version v1 (v0.2.81:**1.xxx**), so see [this instructions](../../v1#installation). You will need to install [`no_send_scroll.plugin.js`](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl?url=https://github.com/samogot/betterdiscord-plugins/blob/master/v1/no_send_scroll.plugin.js) and [`1lib_discord_internals.plugin.js`](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl?url=https://github.com/samogot/betterdiscord-plugins/blob/master/v1/1lib_discord_internals.plugin.js) files. If you are on windows - just download and run them.

This plugin also supports alpha BetterDiscord version v2 for developers only. If you one of them, you do not need any instruction, but still there is [one](../README.md#installation).

This plugin depends on [Lib Discord Internals](../1Lib%20Discord%20Internals) so install it too!
